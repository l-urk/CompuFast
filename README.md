# CompuFast
Running this on your PC in the background will make it faster. (Serious).
What the hell is this?
It checks every file in the entire system. This will give the cpu something to do, and also the HDD/SSD something to do instead of being idle.
Try running it, you might be suprised.


By the way. if you're worries about running the file the entire code is written within the batch file for analysis. this is safe.
